# HashMap Project

### HashMap | The Odin Project | JavaScript

This is the eighth project of the "JavaScript" course within "The Odin Project".

The main goal of this project is to practice data structures.

In particular, this project aims to implement a hashmap data structure in JavaScript.

`hashmap.js` includes the class for the data structure, and `main.js` showcases it.
*Additionally, `hashset.js` includes a "HashSet" data structure which is similar to a hashmap but contains only keys instead of "{ key: value }" pairs.*

*This project is a CLI-based project (i.e., there is no GUI component), you will need to run this project in the command line via the node CLI utility (installed with NodeJS) using the command `node main.js`.*

*Due to the fact that ES6 modules are used within this project, you might run into issues whilst attempting to run this code. Make sure that you are using node v22 at least (you can check via `node -v`) so node can automatically detect ES6 modules without requiring any further configuration.*

**Skills demonstrated: HashMaps, data structures, algorithms**
